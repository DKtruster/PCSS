# PCSS-AutoCardgame

This program is an automatic card game, with ancient warlords as its theme.

Start the program by running the main.py file.

Create your deck, by picking cards from the shop and press the "end turn", when you are ready for combat.

The game ends when one of the two players are out of health points.
