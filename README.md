# PCSS-AutoCardgame

This program is an automatic card game, with ancient warlords as its theme.

Start the program by running the main.py file.

Then start the server by running the gameRun.py file.

Create your deck, by picking 5 cards from the shop and press the "end turn", when you are ready for combat.
